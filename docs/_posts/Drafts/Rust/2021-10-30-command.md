```
The TOML (Tomâ€™s Obvious, Minimal Language) format,
```

- We can build a project using `cargo build`.
- We can build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`.
- We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using `cargo check`.
- Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the `target/debug` directory.
- `cargo build --release` to compile it with optimizations.
