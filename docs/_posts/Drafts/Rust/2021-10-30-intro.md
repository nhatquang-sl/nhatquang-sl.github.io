# const vs let
| const                             | let                                     |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| only immutable                    | - immutable by default<br>- mut mutable |
| always annotate the type          |                                         |
| only assign a constant expression |                                         |

# Shadowing
- We can shadow a variable by using the same variable's name and repeating the use of the `let` keyword.

# Integer types
| Length  | Signed  | Unsigned |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 8-bit   | `i8`    | `u8`     |
| 16-bit  | `i16`   | `u16`    |
| 32-bit  | `i32`   | `u32`    |
| 64-bit  | `i64`   | `u64`    |
| 128-bit | `i128`  | `u128`   |
| arch    | `isize` | `usize`  |

- Signed numbers from -(2<sup>n-1</sup>) to 2<sup>n-1</sup> - 1
- Unsigned numbers from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup> - 1
- The `isize` and `usize` types depend on the kind of computer your program is running on: 64 bits if you're on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you're on a 32-bit architecture.

# Integer Literals

| Number literals  | Example       |
|------------------|---------------|
| Decimal          | `98_222`      |
| Hex              | `0xff`        |
| Octal            | `0o77`        |
| Binary           | `0b1111_0000` |
| Byte (`u8` only) | `b'A'`        |
- `_` use as a visual separator.

# Floating-Point Types
There are 2 types of floating-point types:
- `f32` type is a single-precision float.
- `f64` is default type that has double precision.

# Compound Types
Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types:
- `tuple` is a general way of grouping together a number of values with variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.
```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    // let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
    
    // access a tuple element directly
    println!("The value of tup0: {}, tup1: {}, tup2: {}", tup.0, tup.1 , tup.2);

    // destructuring
    let (x, y, z) = tup;
    println!("The value of x: {}, y: {}, z: {}", x, y , z);

}
```
- `array`: 
  - Every element must have the same type.
  - Fixed length.
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let b: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let c = [3; 5]; // = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];
    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```
